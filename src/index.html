          <p>We have had some customers who mistakenly believe they have a store account when in fact they are only signed up to recieve our VIP Club newsletter</p>
          <p>If you recieve our newsletter but have never made a purchase online this might apply to you, the best way to check this is to do the following:</p>

          <p class="larger">1. Go back to the <a href="/">register page</a></p>
          <p class="larger">
            2. Register with your email address
            <span>If do you already have an account the form will tell you</span>
          </p>

          <p>If the form tells you you already have an account and the password reset doesn't work please contact the Customer Service Team on 033 900 0094</p>
